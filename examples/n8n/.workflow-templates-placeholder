# n8n Workflow Templates

The workflow JSON files will be added here as they are created from real use cases.

To create a workflow template:

1. Build the workflow in n8n
2. Remove any sensitive credentials
3. Export as JSON
4. Add to this directory
5. Document in README.md

Expected workflow files:
- server-monitoring.json
- daily-summary.json
- airtable-integration.json
- webhook-to-notification.json
